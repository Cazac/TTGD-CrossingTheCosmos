  eventDescription: "Without hesitation you tackle the member to the ground.  They
    flail wildly, shouting obscenities and calling for help.  Other crew members
    rush in and see you grappling with the crew mate.  They break up the fight, but
    you get dirty looks from everyone as the crazed crew member starts spouting off
    about how you attacked him with no reason. You try to defend yourself but the
    optics are not good. At least the crew is safe for now.\r"
