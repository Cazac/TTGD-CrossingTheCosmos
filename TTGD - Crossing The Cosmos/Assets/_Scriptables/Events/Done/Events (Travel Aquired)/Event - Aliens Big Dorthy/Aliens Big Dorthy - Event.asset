  eventDescription: "The alien you named Dorothy is now the unofficial mascot of
    the ship.  The entire crew loves seeing her prance around the ship\u2019s corridors,
    and someone has already taught her how to play fetch!  That being said, Dorothy
    has grown twice her size in just under a week, and with that amount of growth
    comes a lot of food\u2026.  Dorothy has been eating up your food supplies, enough
    to feed three more crew members in just a week.  Even though she\u2019s very
    well behaved, this could become a supply problem.\r"
  eventOption1_Choice: "Well, Dorothy IS the unofficial mascot of the ship \u2013
    can\u2019t get rid of her now!  Keep Dorothy and continue to feed her like normal."

  eventOption2_Choice: Compromise - cut down the amount of food that you give Dorothy
    to save some resources but also to keep the crew happy.

  eventOption3_Choice: "The fact that Dorothy grew so much in just one week alarms
    you.  It\u2019s probably best to get rid of Dorothy now \u2013 via airlock."
