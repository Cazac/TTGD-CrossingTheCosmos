  eventDescription: "On the way towards your destination, you come across what seems
    to be an abandoned ship. The ship\u2019s exterior gives the illusion of prolonged
    inactivity. There is a possibility there could be survivors on board or even
    supplies to help your voyage. Or perhaps the ship itself could be salvaged for
    parts. "

    supplies and possible survivors. '
