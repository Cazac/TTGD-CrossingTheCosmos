  eventDescription: "You always scan for lifeforms of the planets you search, and
    don\u2019t venture to ones that contain sentient life.  However, this latest
    planet you\u2019ve visited contains some large creatures, despite your sensors
    claiming otherwise.  They don\u2019t seem too bothered by your explorers on the
    ground.  What are you going to do?"
  eventOption1_Choice: Hunt them - we can always use more food.
