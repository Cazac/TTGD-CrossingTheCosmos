  eventDescription: "You are completely in shock by the behaviour the bot. It is
    not doing what it has been programmed to do. You startle the bot by yelling your
    demands. The bot\u2019s eyes turn from blue to red as it directs its flailing
    arms towards you. Unfortunately, you must activate its kill switch and the bot
    instantly shuts down in front of you. What a strange night! You wonder what would
    have happened if you had just watched it. But perhaps it is better you don\u2019t
    know."
